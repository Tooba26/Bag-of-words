# Bag-of-words

A bag of word measures the occurence of a word in a document. It does not take grammer or structure of the sentences or words. It just counts that how many times a word occured in a document.

The purpose of BoW is feature extraction from text data. Because machine cannot understand the text data so it is converted into number for machine readability.

It is used for NLP tasks such text classification and sentiment analysis. 

## Steps to implement BoW in Python
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Creating a vocabulary
3. Calculate word frequencies
4. Vectorization
